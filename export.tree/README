Pattern Separation beyond the Hippocampus: A High-Resolution Whole-Brain Investigation of Mnemonic Discrimination in Healthy Adults

ABSTRACT
Episodic memory depends on the computational process of pattern separation in order to establish distinct memory representations of similar episodes. Studies of pattern separation in humans rely on mnemonic discrimination tasks, which have been shown to tax hippocampal-dependent pattern separation. Although previous neuroimaging research has focused on hippocampal processing, little is known about how other brain regions known to be involved in recognition memory performance are involved in mnemonic discrimination tasks. Conversely, neuroimaging studies of pattern separation with whole-brain coverage lack spatial resolution to localize activation to hippocampal subfields. In this study, forty-eight healthy young adult participants underwent whole-brain high-resolution functional MRI (fMRI) scanning while completing a mnemonic discrimination task. A priori region of interest analyses revealed activation patterns consistent with pattern separation in distinct hippocampal subregions, particularly in the subiculum. Exploratory whole-brain analysis revealed similar patterns of activation in a network of regions including the parahippocampal cortex, amygdala, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, the inferior frontal gyrus, and the angular gyrus. Taken together, these results suggest a network of brain regions contribute to mnemonic discrimination performance.

MRI METHODS

All MR imaging was performed on a Siemens 3 Tesla TIM Trio scanner (Erlangen, Germany) using a 32-channel receive-only head coil. Structural images were acquired using a T1-weighted MP-RAGE sequence with the following parameters: 192 interleaved slices; total acquisition = 8:55 min; TR = 20 ms; TE = 4.92 ms; flip angle = 25°; field of view = 256 mm; slice thickness = 1 mm; voxel resolution = 1.0×1.0×1.0 mm; 1 average. In addition, high-resolution structural images were also obtained since these have been previously proposed to be particularly well-suited when evaluating medial temporal lobe subfields (Carr, Rissman, & Wagner, 2010). Thus, a T2-weighted pulse sequence was acquired with the following parameters: 35 interleaved slices; total acquisition = 9:44 min; TR = 6000 ms; TE = 64 ms; flip angle = 129°; field of view = 200 mm; slice thickness = 2 mm; voxel resolution = 0.4×0.4×2.0 mm; averages = 2. This scan was positioned perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus for each participant prior to acquisition.

High-resolution functional images were acquired using gradient-echo echoplanar, T2*-weighted pulse sequence utilizing a multi-band (MB) technique (Xu et al., 2013); six functional scans were conducted that coincided with six blocks of the MST. These scans had the following parameters: 72 interleaved slices; TA = 6:25 min; TR = 875 ms; TE = 43.6 ms; flip angle 55°; field of view = 180 mm; slice thickness = 1.8 mm; voxel resolution = 1.8×1.8×1.8 mm; multi-band factor = 8; measurements = 428. These scans were aligned with the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus for each participant. The first four TRs of each run were discarded to allow for T1 equilibration.
